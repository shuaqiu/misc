    ' Test a number whether is a prime
    '
    ' The simplest primality test is as follows: Given an input number n, check
    ' whether any integer m from 2 to n/2 divides n. If n is divisible by any m
    ' then n is composite, otherwise it is prime.
    '
    ' However, rather than testing all m up to n/2, it is only necessary to test
    ' m up to sqrt(n): if n is composite then it can be factored into two values,
    ' at least one of which must be less than or equal to sqrt(n).
    '
    ' The efficiency can also be improved by skipping all even m except 2, since
    ' if any even number divides n then 2 does.
    '
    ' It can be improved further by observing that all primes are of the form
    ' 6k - 1 or 6k + 1, with 2 and 3 being the only exceptions. This is because
    ' all integers can be expressed as (6k + i) for some integer k and for
    ' i = -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4; 2 divides (6k + 0), (6k + 2), (6k + 4); and 3
    ' divides (6k + 3). So a more efficient method is to test if n is divisible
    ' by 2 or 3, then to check through all the numbers of form
    ' 6k - 1 or 6k + 1 <= sqrt(n) . This is 3 times as fast as testing all m.

    ' 1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).

    '    2p, 3p, 4p, etc.; note that some of them may have already been marked.
    ' 4. Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked.
    '    If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this
    '    number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
